Hello! I am a senior computer science major at the University of Texas at Arlington and am currently looking for entry level software engineering roles after graduating in December 2023. I am primarily interested in backend engineering and have significant experience with Java and Spring Boot through multiple internships. I have some experience with React and TypeScript as well.
