Hello! I am Keshav Balaji, a sophomore computer science major at The University of Texas at Arlington. I am currently looking for opportunities to explore 
software engineering and am interested in web development, mobile app development, and game development. My hobbies include reading fictional books, watching and playing video games, 
and working on programming projects. In the long run, I am hoping to build a career as a software engineer.

I have gained extensive experience with C# and object-oriented design through several game development projects. For example, I am contributing to the development of an educational 
game using C# and Unity and have developed several systems for the game, such as the time, purchasing, and character customization systems. This game will be published to Steam in the upcoming month(s). I have familiarity with Java and C through my programming classes. I explored mobile app development in a recent collaborative project using Flutter and Dart and developed a forum app prototype. I recently participated in a hackathon and contributed to the development of the front-end of a translation app using JavaScript, React Native, and Node.js. I have also been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to learn the fundamentals of web development.

In all these projects, I have contributed to ideation, worked on the implementation of the ideas, and created necessary presentations to communicate the projectâ€™s importance. I 
have been cultivating my problem-solving skills and possess the communication skills necessary for effective collaboration. These projects have involved several challenges, and 
I have collaboratively worked to overcome the challenges. I am capable of working on long-term collaborative projects and thrive in challenging environments.
