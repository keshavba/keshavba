Hello! I am a junior computer science major at The University of Texas at Arlington who is currently looking for software engineering internships for Spring and Summer 2023. I am primarily interested in backend engineering and am exploring machine learning through classwork and work experience. My hobbies include reading fictional books, watching and playing video games, and working on programming projects. In the long run, I am hoping to build a career as a software engineer.
